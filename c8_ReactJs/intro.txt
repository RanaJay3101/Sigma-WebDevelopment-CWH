-> why React

- React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces


-> JSX 

- JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript
- JSX produces React “elements”
- We can only return one element
- Every tage should be closed
- We can use JavaScript expressions inside JSX
- we need to use className instead of class
